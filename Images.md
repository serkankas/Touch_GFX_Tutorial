1. [Image](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.20/docs/development/ui-development/ui-components/images/image): The image container that can changable from location. This is the one that you cannot re-size. It's good for using original sizes. In order to select an picture (non-default ones), you should press the button that shown at below.

2.  [Scalable Image](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.20/docs/development/ui-development/ui-components/images/scalable-image): This is almost same with basic 'Image', but these container can be resizable.

2. [Tiled Image](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.20/docs/development/ui-development/ui-components/images/tiled-image): This one is basically not scaling the picture, just continue to redraw again. Like in example, ~~I hope that's clear after example~~:

4. [Animated Image](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.20/docs/development/ui-development/ui-components/images/animated-image): This page has cool example. However, I couldn't make it worked in that way. Only thing (as far as I could see is) two different picture and change with desired time. ~~This one need to be checked in more detailed.~~

4. [Texture Mapping](https://support.touchgfx.com/4.20/docs/development/ui-development/ui-components/images/texture-mapper): The example is abviously clear. The controls under the "Properties" section. In that section find the tab called "Angle & Scale". With that, you can create cool flipping effect, etc. ~~Be Creative~~
