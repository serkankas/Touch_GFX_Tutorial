## GUI Explanation

In this section, I will explain the GUI interface as much as I can. It actually has straightforward GUI, but in case you may need anything I will go through it.

When you open the screen, you probably end up with this screen. Select either "Create" button and select your desired board. After selected, you will end up cleaner version of main scren.

I divide that screen into 5 part:
1. Screens
1. Properties/Interactions
1. Designing Screen
1. Code Generation and Simulation
1. File Location and Setting.

For faster explanation,
1. Screens: This is the part where you can add/remove your screen layout as well as the component that you add in that screen. You can delete them individually or all of it.
1. Properties/Interactions: The interaction section is actual place where you add some functionality to your application. This will be covered in other section. Properties, as the name suggest, shows the properties of whatever item selected.
1. Designing Screen: This is the section where you can easily design your screen/s. The Layout can be designed/add/dropped in this section.
1. Code Generation and Simulation: This section is different from the older version. When you complete your design, you need to press first button in here, which is corresponded for generating the code version of the your design. Second button is for simulation. I ~~personally~~ do not use that button a lot. When you change the code ~~you probably will, in order to make an actually working design~~, the simulation will fail. Do not panic! I never used the third option, you may look for it.
1. File Location part will be important. Because you will not start your project from your IDE directly. Instead, you will open the file location and boot your project from there.

This section is over in here. As I said before, it's fairly straightforward section.
