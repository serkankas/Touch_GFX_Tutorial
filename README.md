## Cheatsheet For Touch GFX Designer
#### This file will contain how-to knowledge with small examples.
###### Please use it with your own responsible, it's ment to be a guide. Not a real resource. Highly advice to send message to forum if you have any question. __I AM NOT EXPERTISE ON THAT PROGRAM__

This repository will contain seperated parts and related markdown file for it.<br>
I am planning to seperate sheet 10 parts:
- [X] Installation
- [X] GUI Explanation
- [X] Buttons
- [X] Interractions ~~(subtopic of GUI)~~
- [X] Images
- [ ] Containers
- [ ] Shapes
- [ ] Progress Indicators
- [ ] Miscellanous
- [ ] Custom Containers

I highly suggest to follow these files in order. So that if you will follow, you catch-up with what I am going to do.<br>
In other words when I talk about progress indicators, I ~~probably~~ talked about interractions before-hand. I am not dive in details at that section.<br>
